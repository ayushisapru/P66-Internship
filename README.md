# P66-Internship

During my internship at Phillips 66, I worked on a POC focused on anomaly detection and real-time notification for refinery data using Azure services. I developed an Azure Function App to fetch data from an Azure Data Explorer database, implemented a custom anomaly detection algorithm using PandasDF for data analysis, and integrated with Microsoft Teams to notify engineers of anomalies. The Function App runs on a schedule, identifies irregularities in the refinery data, and releases notification cards to a Teams channel, providing engineers with timely insights.
